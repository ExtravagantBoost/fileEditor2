## Welcome
this is **fileEditor 2**, an improved and more innovative sequel to [*fileEditor*](https://fileEditor.extravagantboost.repl.co),
in this version of *fileEditor*, some notable changes have ensued after the original make.


### changes…
1. Updated old codemirror version from [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Codemirror%205-gray?logo=codemirror)](https://codemirror.net/5/) to [6](https://codemirror.net) to further support ES6 syntax, so was fileEditor2’s code when doing many actions.
2. new protocols placed to prevent errors when creating another file with the same name. for example the filename: ```smile.js``` already exists, when the user tries to create another file with the same name where ```smile.js``` subsequently becomes ```smile1.js```, rather than creating an internal error when doing so in fileEditor.
3. many changes to the editor due to the upgrade to [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Codemirror%206-gray?logo=codemirror)](https://codemirror.net)
4. FileEditor 2 will be accompanied with many more things to help the user to have an easier experience while coding

### Modules
- an upgrade from [![js-beautify](https://img.shields.io/badge/Js--beautify-gray?logo=github)](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify) to [![prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/Prettier-gray?logo=github4)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) a more smarter beautifier engine.
- FileEditor is still going to be sticking to [![Jshint](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jshint-gray?logo=github)](https://github.com/jshint/jshint) because its a good linter, but soon FileEditor2 is going to move away from that.
- [commonmark](https://commonmark.org) otherwise known as MarkDown, is now going to be used, so that users can now see what their markdown file is going to look like when they code in markdown
